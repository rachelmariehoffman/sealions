As it was, SCFC managed only two shots on goal the entire match.\r\n\r\n\"We felt like we should have been up 5-0 by halftime,\" said San Diego captain and midfielder Rosie Tantillo-Colon (USC\/FC Gold Pride). \"We had great rhythm going forward, and our eagerness to get some goals had us playing a more direct attack than we normally play.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Tantillo Colon\u2019s one-touch pass to Hix (Mira Costa College) who had broken open down the left side that led to the goal, a smooth left-footed shot from near the end-line that tucked just inside the right post.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was the most difficult shot we took all afternoon,\u201d added Lalor. \u201cA lot of players and teams would have missed that chance, especially in light of all the earlier chances that hadn\u2019t succeeded.

It took a spectacular save from SeaLions goalkeeper Kaycee Gunion (CSU-San Marcos) to keep the score 0-0. That was the only, and last, real chance South Coast would see in the game.\r\n\r\n\"The game highlighted some of our strengths of character, and it also showed us what we should work on,\u201d noted Assistant Coach Lu Snyder. \u201cWe also saw good things from our newcomers Monica Dolinsky (Kansas) whose link-up play in midfield kept us on the attack, and Sam Staab (Clemson), whose solid defending helped give us the confidence to repeatedly go forward.
